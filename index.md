# Hello

I'm Jean Barbier, a researcher in the Mathematical Physics of Signals and Learning at the [International Center for Theoretical Physics (ICTP)](https://www.ictp.it/). It is located in Trieste, Italy, a gorgeous city on the Adriatic sea [famous for its quality of life](https://www.italofile.com/best-places-to-live-in-italy-2021/), and known as the "City of Science". I'm also affiliated to the the [Departement of Data science at SISSA](https://datascience.sissa.it/), also in Trieste. 

My research interests are centered around _information processing systems_ such as appearing in machine learning, communications, signal processing and computer sciences. I often study these systems and associated algorithms using Statistical Physics --the language of _phase transitions_-- but also its close related cousin Information Theory. I try to precisely quantify what are the optimal performance one can aim for when processing (big) data, as well as how close optamility one can operate when using _efficient_ algorithms. 

To contact me use **jbarbier@ictp.it**

You can find a **short CV** [here](./docs/cv.pdf).

All my article can be found through my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yeE5qqIAAAAJ&hl=en).

A "wide audience" video on physics and information processing systems is on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1VO5dmymFM&t=5s&ab_channel=ICTPMathematics). to go further without having to read a full research paper, check this [perspective article I wrote](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.14863.pdf). 

Few quotes I find particularly relevant:

> If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough. -- Albert Einstein
 
> An expert is a man who has made all the mistakes which can be made in a very narrow field. -- Niels Bohr

> Physics is like sex: sure, it may give some practical results, but that's not why we do it. -- Richard Feynman

I addition to science, I also enjoy a lot electronic music ([some musical experiments from another life](https://soundcloud.com/junkosaur)), and pretty much any kind of mean to ride/glide fast on snow, water or air. I also love free diving.

# ERC project CHORAL: Computational Hardness Of RepresentAtion Learning

I feel honoured to be a recipient of a 1.3 million euros Starting Grant in Mathematics from the [European Research Council](https://erc.europa.eu/news/erc-2021-starting-grants-results?fbclid=IwAR0-AB0MH9WFvlv3Ynp9Z6EMXy_0igRVLsIAiUlB7h79ftnLslV5Pxv_Qp8). I'm now in the process of hiring brilliant motivated researchers to form a research group at ICTP to carry out this exciting project. 

CHORAL will develop novel statistical tools to better quantify the performance of Neural Networks trained on structured data (among other machine learning algorithms), using random matrix theory, statistical mechanics and information theory. Neural Nets are amazingly powerful algorithms, but their theoretical understanding remains limited when compared to their evergrowing applications in science and technology. 

I have **multiple positions open at the postdoctoral level on this ERC project**. These positions are up to 4 years and come with a competitive package (ICTP researchers are exempted of income tax), a teaching load decided by the postdoc himself, substantial funds for travelling and computer equipemnts, all that in ideal working conditions in a [exciting and interdisciplinary environment](https://www.ictp.it/research/qls.aspx). 

The ideal candidate has a background in at least one or two of the following disciplines:

* Random matrix theory
* Disordered systems / spin glasses (from a mathematics or physics perspective)
* Mathematical statistics
* Probability
* Information theory
* Theoretical machine learning, theory of gradient-based dynamics
* Theory of approximate message passing algorithms


Feel free to contact me to know more about the project and do not hesitate to spread the word :)
