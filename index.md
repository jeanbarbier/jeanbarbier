# Hello

I'm Jean Barbier, a researcher in Physics and Mathematics at the [International Center for Theoretical Physics](https://www.ictp.it/). My research interests are mainly concerned with _information processing systems_ such as appearing in machine learning, communications, signal processing and computer sciences. I often study these systems and the associated algorithms using statistical physics --the language used to describe _phase transitions_-- but also information theory. try to precisely quantify what are the optimal performance one can aim for when processing (big) data, as well as how close optamility one can operate when using _efficient_ algorithms.

You can check a short CV [here](./CV.pdf).



A quote I like from Niels Bohr:

> An expert is a man who has made all the mistakes which can be made in a very narrow field.

# ERC grant CHORAL: "Computational Hardness Of RepresentAtion Learning"

I feel honoured to be a recipient of a prestigious grant from the [European Research Council](https://erc.europa.eu/news/erc-2021-starting-grants-results?fbclid=IwAR0-AB0MH9WFvlv3Ynp9Z6EMXy_0igRVLsIAiUlB7h79ftnLslV5Pxv_Qp8). I'm now in the process of creating a research group at ICTP to carry out my project. We will develop novel statistical tools to better quantify the performance of Neural Networks. These are amazingly powerful algorithms at the core of machine learning --the powerhouse of the "Big-Data era"--, but whose theoretical understanding remains limited when compared to their evergrowing applications in science and technology. 

I have **muliple positions open at the postdoctoral level**. The ideal candidate have a background in at least one or two of the following disciplines:

* Random matrix theory
* Disordered systems / spin glasses (from a mathematics or physics perspectives)
* Information theory
* Theoretical machine learning, theory of gradient-based dynamics
* Theory of approximate message passing algorithms
