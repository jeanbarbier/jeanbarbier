# Hello

I'm Jean Barbier, a researcher in Physics and Mathematics at the [International Center for Theoretical Physics](https://www.ictp.it/). My research interests are mainly concerned with _information processing systems_ such as appearing in machine learning, communications, signal processing and computer sciences. I often study these systems using statistical physics and information theory, and try to precisely quantify the optimal performance in processing (big) data, as well as how close to this efficient algorithms may work.

A quote I like from Niels Bohr is

> An expert is a man who has made all the mistakes which can be made, in a narrow field.
